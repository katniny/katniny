Hi, I'm Katty! I'm a very ambitious 16 year old developer, who enjoys programming in JavaScript and Rust, but I've dabbled into C++ as well. 

Everything I make is built around **privacy** because I believe in the right to privacy.

## Projects:
* I maintain <a href="https://github.com/katniny/transsocial">TransSocial</a>, a free, open-source social media platform, designed to be a safe, privacy-respecting place for everyone.
* I also maintain my own browser named <a href="https://github.com/katniny/meowser">Meowser</a> (to be rebranded soon), a fast open-source no-BS browser built around privacy.

Always building, so any and all help on anything is majorly appreciated! 😊

## Contact
I'm not active on many socials besides <a href="https://transs.social/u/katniny" target="_blank">TransSocial</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/wARaSDvVeF" target="_blank">Discord</a>, so those are the recommended ways to contact me, as I will not respond on Twitter, Instagram, Bluesky, or email.
